                    <p>It&#39;s not everyday a pup born with a deformity in a remote part of the country finds a home with 20
                        other dogs in New York! <br>
                        It was about 5 months ago when Shea was born outside &#39;s my home. We noticed that there was
                        something wrong with her hind legs, we immediately took her to a few vets in Delhi who all said that
                        she won&#39;t be able to walk on all 4 again. I had absolutely no idea what we could do for her in India
                        but we still started searching for a foster. <br><br>
                        It was then that we got in touch with Chris and Mariesa who immediately fell in love with her and
                        wanted to adopt her. The kind of work these guys do on a daily basis in the US is absolutely
                        amazing! We knew that she&#39;ll never be able to find someone better.</p>
                        <p>None of this would have been possible without shreemoyee from @dog_tales1 who has been our
                            biggest supporter. Thank you thank you so much for being there. It&#39;s only because of you that Shea
                            is home today!</p>

                        for the homeless. During this time of corona crisis due to the lockdown the poor people are not
                        getting food and when they go to people&#39;s home for asking food they are not allowed to enter due to
                        the corona infection. People are dying due to corona lets not make them die due to hunger.</p>
                    <p>We were able to collect more than 50 thousand is less than 24 hours from which we We were able to
                        make around 150 packets.
